                    <h2><time>12/22/2018</time></h2>
                    <p>I put the new <abbr title="New Orleans Secular Humanist Association">NOSHA</abbr> decals on two cups, along with a Christmas bells cup, and a bear/Indian cup.  Later in the afternoon I poured two cups, a stein, a three-legged salsa bowl, a small round box, and an oval box.  Everything is low fire.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2><time>12/23/2018</time></h2>
                    <p>I started an early morning decal firing in the little kiln (cone 016) for the items I put the decals on yesterdays.  I also took everything out of the molds that I had poured yesterday.  I'd like to do another pour before having to return to work on Thursday, the 27th</p>
                    <p>In the afternoon I threw four cups from the 5 lb ball of Black Pepper - midrange clay.</p>
                    <hr />
                    <h2><time>12/24/2018</time></h2>
                    <p>I trimmed two of the Black Pepper mugs I threw about two weeks ago, before deciding they were still too moist to trim.  I incised two of the chocolate mugs; one with a wolf, and the other with a moose and a bear.  I did another pour; two cups, another three-legged bowl, a round box and an oval box, and a platter.  I also furthered the preparations for Ron's sailboat bowl and the Flamingo stein.  I also rolled out three 6" diameter slabs for trivet - low fire.</p>

                    <h2><time>12/26/2018</time></h2>
                    <p>I fired the little kiln to bisque fire two molded cups and two low-fire hand thrown cups.  The two molded cups are intended for <abbr title="New Orleans Secular Humanist Association">NOSHA</abbr> decals, ... that'll make a total of four for the next meeting.  I'll put <abbr title="United States Marine Corps">USMC</abbr> decals on one of the hand-thrown cups.</p>
                    <p>I also cleaned up the beehive cookie jar, a small tiki mug, and a Buddha and an elephant in preparation for a bisque firing and then mailing to Rebekah.</p>
                    <p>I also put the second coat of underglaze on the sailboat bowl for Ron.</p>

I put the first coat of Harvest Gold underglaze on the beehive cookie jar.  I put a second coat of Chocolate underglaze on the spots on the giraffi cup, along with a third cup on most of the sailboat bowl.  I also put another coat of Squash Yellow underglaze and Terra Cotta underglaze on the bear cup.</p>

                    <p>I started the little kiln about <time>1:15pm</time> with four cups; two that had been previously bisque fired that Peg put an underglaze on the inside, the Fleur-di-Lis cup, and the underwear cup.</p>
                    <p>I also put a second coat of white dots and then a first and second coat of smaller Bright Blue underglaze spots on the red cup, and the second and thirds coats of Ruby Red underglaze on the Holidays cup.  I put the third coats of Orange Sorget, Lavendar, and Tuscon Turquoise on the Harvest Gold cup, along with a single coat of a Chocolate Brown border around the ovals.  I put a Jet Black border around all the circles on the Light Gray cup.  I'm hoping to bisque fire these four cups in the little kiln tomorrow, or Sunday.</p>

                    <p>I started a bisque firing in the little kiln just before 11 am, with miscellaneous items in it; the abstract fish bowl, a small, six-sided flower pot of Pegs, a salsa bowl, and an oval jar.  I also fired five little pink pig's ears that would go on the pig that Mr. Stephen asked me to fix.</p>

					<h2><time>1/22/2020</time></h2>
                    <p>I continued putting low-fire clear glaze on the aqua-fish bowl and the peacock stein, and started putting low-fire clear glaze on the five little pig's ears for Mr. Stephen's appetizer pig.</p>
					<p>We're hoping to do a low-fire glaze firing in the big kiln sometime this coming weekend.
